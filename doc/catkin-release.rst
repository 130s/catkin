Creating debian packages for "Native" catkin projects
-----------------------------------------------------

Environment
===========

First verify that catkin's ``git`` utilities are in your path::

    % which git-catkin
    /home/catkin/test/src/catkin/bin/git-catkin

If they aren't, source your :ref:`environment setup files <envfiles>` as appropriate.

Create your upstream release
============================

Fix up your project and commit a release.  *Upstream* is the
repository where your main development happens, and from which you
would like to make packages.  An upstream release means *to mark your
code with a version number*.

These instructions will walk you through creating a sample release.
We'll use ``STACK`` to represent the stack being released.

1. Ensure that :ref:`stack.yaml`\ 's ``Version`` field is correct, and
   meaningful: ``MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH``.  Specify all three numbers,
   including trailing zeros.  Remember to commit your change.

2. Create a tag whose name exactly corresponds to your ``Version`` number,
   and is pointing to the commit you would like to release.  If your
   version number is 0.1.1, depending on your version-control tool you
   would do something like:

   ``git``::

    git commit -m "0.1.1, minor release" stack.yaml
    git tag -a 0.1.1 -m "Releasing 0.1.1"
    git push
    git push --tags

   ``hg``::

     hg something or other

   ``svn`` (``https://path/to/STACK/branch`` is where the code is being developed, e.g. ``trunk``)::

     svn cp -m "Releasing 0.1.1" https://path/to/STACK/branch https://path/to/tags/STACK-0.1.1

First- time release
===================

Create the GBP repository
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

We're going to create a :term:`git-buildpackage (GBP) repository <GBP
repository>` using ``git`` and ``git-buildpackage``.
``git-buildpackage`` is a popular tool for creating and managing
debian packages using git repositories.  Think of the GBP repository
as a *release staging area*.

Create a new GBP repository for your release
(*reminder: "STACK" should be replaced with your stack's name*)::

  mkdir STACK-release
  cd STACK-release
  git init .

We need to tell the catkin tools how to get our upstream code using
the ``catkin-set-upstream`` command.  The command is called with the
upstream URL and VCS type (e.g. ``git``, ``svn``, ``hg``):

  ``git``::

    git catkin-set-upstream git://github.com/someproject/STACK.git git

  ``svn`` (set to the release tag URL)::

    git catkin-set-upstream https://path/to/STACK/tag/STACK-0.1.1 svn

You should now be on an orphaned branch in your repository, called
``catkin``, which was created by the ``catkin-set-upstream`` command.
If you look at ``catkin.conf``, you will see the upstream URL and VCS
type.

Now, let's get back to ``master`` branch if everything looks
good::

  git checkout master

This isn't strictly necessary, but it helps show how things are
configured. ``master`` is the main branch from which debian packages
are created.

Now that we have a catkin release repository, we can import from
upstream using the ``catkin-import-upstream`` command::

  git catkin-import-upstream

This will export the upstream repository and import it in GBP
repository.  The exact behavior depends on your version control tool:

 - ``git``: catkin will look for a tag in in your upstream repo that
   corresponds to the ``Version`` in the ``stack.yaml``.

 - ``svn``: catkin will export the upstream URL that you provided.
   Please make sure this is the exact code corresponding to
   ``Version``.

Creating the debian package
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

We will now use the ``catkin-generate-debian`` command to create our
debian package configuration files.  This command creates/updates a
``debian/`` folder.  It also creates git tags that are used for
creating source and binary debians from your GBP repository.  We're
going to run this command with the ``fuerte`` argument to setup a
release for the ``fuerte`` distribution::

  git catkin-generate-debian fuerte

To test the debians try checking out a tag and using ``git
buildpackage`` to create a binary debian.  In our example, we released
version ``0.1.1`` and created a debian package for ``fuerte``.  This
means the tag for the Ubuntu Oneiric platform is
``debian/ros_fuerte_0.1.1_oneiric`` tag.  To build a debian package
for this platform::

  git checkout debian/ros_fuerte_0.1.1_oneiric
  git clean -dxf
  git buildpackage -uc -us --git-ignore-new --git-ignore-branch

Push it public
++++++++++++++

Now it's time to save your work and make it public.  Use git to add a
``remote`` repository for your GBP repository.  This remote repository
should be public (e.g. on GitHub).  ``push`` your data to the remote
repository to make it public. Remember to substitute the correct
URL/username for your project::

  git remote add origin git@github.com:project/STACK-release.git
  git push --all
  git push --tags


Subsequent Releases
===================

Choose a temporary directory somewhere in a quiet place, free from
distractions.

Clone your GBP repository
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Clone your :term:`GBP repository` (use a pushable URI for convenience)::

  git clone git@github.com:wg-debs/STACK.git
  cd STACK

You should see tags for upstream source and debian releases::

  % git tag
  upstream/0.1.18
  upstream/0.1.19
  ...
  debian/ros_fuerte_0.2.2_lucid
  debian/ros_fuerte_0.2.2_natty
  debian/ros_fuerte_0.2.2_oneiric

There may be a great many of these.  You'll see that there are three
upstream branches::

  % git branch -r
  origin/HEAD -> origin/master
  origin/catkin
  origin/master
  origin/upstream

Since you are about to import upstream source, you can verify what
will be imported::

  % git show origin/catkin:catkin.conf
  [catkin]
          upstream = git@github.com:project/STACK.git
          upstreamtype = git

This is essentially catting the file ``catkin.conf`` from the
origin's ``catkin`` branch.


SVN: update your upstream URL
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

For ``svn`` it is important to update this to point to the new release tag::

   git catkin-set-upstream https://path/to/STACK/tags/STACK-0.1.1 svn

Import a new version of upstream
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Now you need to resync with your upstream source using
``catkin-import-upstream``.  The upstream source will be retrieved
from source control and imported in to this :term:`GBP
repository`. You'll be prompted to verify the upstream version::

  git catkin-import-upstream


..

  Example output::

    % git catkin-import-upstream
    STACK has branch catkin.
    Branch upstream set up to track remote branch upstream from origin.
    + git checkout catkin
    Switched to branch 'catkin'
    upstream repo: git@github.com:project/STACK.git
    upstream type: git
    Verifying a couple of things about the upstream git repo
    Verifying that git@github.com:project/STACK.git is a git repo...
    Yup, with 1 heads.
    Verifying that git@github.com:project/STACK.git is not a git-buildpackage repo
    Yup, no upstream branches.
    Cloning into ...

      ...

    What is the upstream version? [0.2.4]

      ...

Create the debian packaging
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Now we need to generate git tags for our release using the ``catkin-generate-debian`` command, which is called with the name of the ROS distribution codename. In this example, we are going to release to the ``fuerte`` ROS distribution::

  git catkin-generate-debian fuerte

..

  Example output::

    % git catkin-generate-debian fuerte
    catkin has branch catkin.
    catkin has branch upstream.
    M	debian/changelog
    Already on 'master'
    Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 2 commits.
    The latest upstream tag in the release repo is upstream/0.1.1
    Upstream version is: 0.1.1
    + cd .tmp/25332/ && git clone git://github.com/ros/rosdep_rules.git
    Cloning into rosdep_rules...
    remote: Counting objects: 106, done.
    remote: Compressing objects: 100% (49/49), done.
    remote: Total 106 (delta 18), reused 94 (delta 7)
    Receiving objects: 100% (106/106), 11.05 KiB, done.
    Resolving deltas: 100% (18/18), done.

    ...

    [master d3cc805] + Creating debian mods for distro: oneiric, rosdistro: fuerte, upstream version: 0.1.1
     1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 1 deletions(-)
    tag: debian/ros_fuerte_0.1.1_oneiric
    + cd . && git tag -f debian/ros_fuerte_0.1.1_oneiric -m Debian release 0.1.1
    Updated tag 'debian/ros_fuerte_0.1.1_oneiric' (was 0000000)


Now we need to verify that your tag got created locally.

First, ``checkout`` a tag that you would like to build. Make sure you
checkout the tag that matches the platform you are on.  In this
example, we checkout for Ubuntu Oneiric::

    git checkout debian/ros_fuerte_0.1.2_oneiric

Next, ``clean`` your checkout. **This will delete all uncommitted content
from your local repo**. There may be temporary files or directories
laying around from previous steps that have to be removed. ::

    git clean -dxf

Use ``git buildpackage`` to build a binary debian. This command will
generate a lot of output.  You may see a lot of errors about
"dir-or-file-in-opt", which is okay::

  git buildpackage -uc -us --git-ignore-new

..

  Example output::

    % git buildpackage -uc -us --git-ignore-new
    dh  clean
       dh_testdir
       dh_auto_clean
    	python2.6 setup.py clean -a
    running clean
    'build/lib.linux-x86_64-2.6' does not exist -- can't clean it
    ...
    E: ros-fuerte-STACK: dir-or-file-in-opt opt/ros/fuerte/share/STACK/
    ...
    Finished running lintian.

A deb should have been produced in the parent directory.  Try installing it (requires ``sudo`` permission)::

    % ls ../*.deb
    ../ros-fuerte-STACK_0.1.1-0oneiric_amd64.deb
    % dpkg -i ../ros-fuerte-STACK_0.1.1-0oneiric_amd64.deb

If this worked and you're satisfied, your ready to ``push`` your packaging to the public::

    git push --all
    git push --tags

..

  Example output::

    % git remote -v
    origin	git@github.com:project/STACK-release.git (fetch)
    origin	git@github.com:project/STACK-release.git (push)
    % git push --all
    Total 0 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
    To git@github.com:project/STACK-release.git

     * [new tag]         debian/ros_fuerte_0.1.1_natty -> debian/ros_fuerte_0.1.1_natty

     * [new tag]         upstream/0.1.1 -> upstream/0.1.1


tips and tricks
===============

This will create a rosinstall file for all repos in a github org::

  github_org_to_install()
  {
    for x in $(github orgs/$1/repos ssh_url+)
    do
    y=$(basename $x)
    echo "- git:
      uri: '$x'
      local-name: release-${y%.git}
      version: master
    "
    done
  }

Call like::

  github_org_to_install wg-debs

Version tools, for upstream releases::

    bump_minor()
    {
       git pull
       which=minor
       old_version=$(catkin-version)
       echo "old version: $old_version"
       catkin-bump-version $which
       version=$(catkin-version)
       echo "new version: $version"
       git commit stack.yaml -m "Bumping $which version $old_version ~> $version"
       git tag -a $version -m "$which release, $version"
       git push
       git push --tags
    }
